# Task2_IOT
This is a code to control the the robot arm with an Arabic language speech.

I used the the speech to text web page I created in the last task to connect with the Arduino UNO and give it orders using speech in arabic language.
This is done by connecting the Arduino UNO with a usb to your PC and then pressing the connect button on the webpage and choosing the correct port.

The connection is done by using the serial baudRate 9600.
